<p>
This inspection reports top-level or object non-const properties which are annotated by <code>@JvmField</code>,
have initializer that can be evaluated in compile-time, have primitive or String type.
Such properties have ConstantValue attribute in bytecode in Kotlin 1.1 or 1.2.
This attribute allows javac to fold usages of the corresponding field, and use that field in annotations.
This can cause incorrect behavior in case of separate or incremental compilation in mixed Java/Kotlin code.
</p>
<p>
This behaviour is subject to change in Kotlin 1.3 (no ConstantValue attribute more).
Recommended action: replace <code>JvmField</code> annotation with <code>const</code> modifier.
